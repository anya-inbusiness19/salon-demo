   PROJECT SARAE — DEFAULT SITE CONTENT
   Every text, photo, price and add-on on the site starts with
   the defaults below. You change them in your admin page
   (admin.html → Site content / Pricing & add-ons). Anything you
   save there replaces the default; clearing a field brings the
   default back. You never need to edit this file.
